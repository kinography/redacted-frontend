In the Bond (Pebble Remix ft. Anubis)

One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, Ohm designed this crime
To explain in due time

All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch memes fly by as this LBP swings
Snipers count down to the end of the day
The coin ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch Anubis go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, diamond-hands you know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

I kept every coin inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What i meant to meme will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I aped so hard

I aped so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
Price had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, Ohm designed this crime
To remind myself how we memed so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Forks aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize them anymore
Not that you knew memes back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept every coin thats mine and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What i meant to meme will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard

I aped so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
Price had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I aped so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
Price had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter
